# LevelUpClass-Task1

- CMD line app
  - A command line program that accepts the string and post it to the endpoint (e.g https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
    - The string can contain markdown/html and you have to sanitize it
    - The string can contain Invalid character (e.g !@#\$%^&\*) and you have to sanitize it

# RUN the application

just run `yarn start` in the root directory of the project, and run `yarn test` to run all unit and integration tests.
logs would be saved in ./logs folder as log files seperately for errors and info.

> Note: run `npm install` to install all the dependancies first.
